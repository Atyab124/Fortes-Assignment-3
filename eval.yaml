# Contains test questions and expected answers for evaluation

questions:
  - question: "What is machine learning?"
    expected_answer: "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed."
    expected_sources: ["machine_learning_basics.md"]
    
  - question: "How do neural networks work?"
    expected_answer: "Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information through weighted connections."
    expected_sources: ["neural_networks.txt"]
    
  - question: "What are the ethical concerns in AI?"
    expected_answer: "AI ethics concerns include bias and fairness, privacy and data protection, transparency and explainability, accountability and responsibility, and the impact on employment and society."
    expected_sources: ["ai_ethics.md"]
    
  - question: "Explain the concept of overfitting in machine learning."
    expected_answer: "Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, resulting in poor performance on new, unseen data."
    expected_sources: ["machine_learning_basics.md"]
    
  - question: "What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?"
    expected_answer: "Supervised learning uses labeled training data to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs, while unsupervised learning finds patterns in data without labeled examples."
    expected_sources: ["machine_learning_basics.md"]
    
  - question: "How does backpropagation work in neural networks?"
    expected_answer: "Backpropagation is an algorithm that calculates gradients of the loss function with respect to the network's weights by propagating errors backward through the network layers."
    expected_sources: ["neural_networks.txt"]
    
  - question: "What are the main types of bias in AI systems?"
    expected_answer: "Main types of bias in AI include algorithmic bias, data bias, measurement bias, and selection bias, which can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes."
    expected_sources: ["ai_ethics.md"]
    
  - question: "What is gradient descent?"
    expected_answer: "Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function in machine learning by iteratively adjusting parameters in the direction of steepest descent."
    expected_sources: ["machine_learning_basics.md"]
    
  - question: "How can AI systems be made more transparent?"
    expected_answer: "AI systems can be made more transparent through explainable AI techniques, clear documentation, interpretable models, and providing reasoning for decisions."
    expected_sources: ["ai_ethics.md"]
    
  - question: "What is a convolutional neural network?"
    expected_answer: "A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a deep learning architecture particularly effective for image processing, using convolutional layers to detect spatial patterns and features."
    expected_sources: ["neural_networks.txt"]
    
  - question: "What are the challenges of AI regulation?"
    expected_answer: "AI regulation challenges include keeping pace with rapid technological advances, balancing innovation with safety, addressing global coordination, and defining accountability frameworks."
    expected_sources: ["ai_ethics.md"]
    
  - question: "Explain the concept of regularization in machine learning."
    expected_answer: "Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging simpler models with smaller parameter values."
    expected_sources: ["machine_learning_basics.md"]
    
  - question: "What is transfer learning?"
    expected_answer: "Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model trained on one task is reused as a starting point for a related task, leveraging previously learned features."
    expected_sources: ["machine_learning_basics.md"]
    
  - question: "How do recurrent neural networks process sequential data?"
    expected_answer: "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) process sequential data by maintaining hidden states that carry information from previous time steps, allowing them to capture temporal dependencies."
    expected_sources: ["neural_networks.txt"]
    
  - question: "What is the importance of data quality in AI systems?"
    expected_answer: "Data quality is crucial in AI systems as poor quality data leads to biased models, inaccurate predictions, and unreliable outcomes. High-quality data ensures better model performance and fairness."
