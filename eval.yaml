  question: "What is supervised learning?"
  expected_answer: "Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled training data to make predictions on new, unseen data."

  question: "What is overfitting in machine learning?"
  expected_answer: "Overfitting occurs when a model performs well on training data but poorly on new data, indicating that the model has learned the training data too well and cannot generalize to unseen data."
  expected_citations: ["machine_learning_basics.md#8"]
  category: "technical"

- id: 14
  question: "What is underfitting in machine learning?"
  expected_answer: "Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data, resulting in poor performance on both training and test data."
