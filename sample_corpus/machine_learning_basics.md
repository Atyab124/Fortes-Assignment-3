# Machine Learning Fundamentals

## Introduction

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that can access data and use it to learn patterns and make predictions or decisions.

## Types of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning

Supervised learning uses labeled training data to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs. The algorithm learns from examples where both the input and desired output are known.

**Key characteristics:**
- Uses labeled training data
- Goal is to learn a function that maps inputs to outputs
- Can be used for both classification and regression tasks
- Examples: spam detection, price prediction, image recognition

**Common algorithms:**
- Linear regression
- Decision trees
- Random forests
- Support vector machines
- Neural networks

### 2. Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning finds patterns in data without labeled examples. The algorithm discovers hidden structures in the data.

**Key characteristics:**
- No labeled training data
- Goal is to find hidden patterns or structures
- Used for clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection
- Examples: customer segmentation, data compression, fraud detection

**Common algorithms:**
- K-means clustering
- Hierarchical clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Autoencoders
- DBSCAN

### 3. Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning learns through interaction with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties for actions taken.

**Key characteristics:**
- Learns through trial and error
- Uses rewards and penalties to guide learning
- Focuses on decision-making in dynamic environments
- Examples: game playing, robotics, autonomous vehicles

**Common algorithms:**
- Q-learning
- Policy gradient methods
- Actor-critic methods
- Deep Q-networks (DQN)

## Core Concepts

### Overfitting and Underfitting

**Overfitting** occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, resulting in poor performance on new, unseen data. Signs of overfitting include:
- High accuracy on training data but low accuracy on test data
- Model complexity that exceeds the complexity of the underlying relationship

**Underfitting** occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data. Signs of underfitting include:
- Low accuracy on both training and test data
- Model that is too simple for the problem complexity

**Solutions:**
- **For overfitting**: Regularization, cross-validation, early stopping, data augmentation
- **For underfitting**: Increase model complexity, reduce regularization, add more features

### Regularization

Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. This encourages simpler models with smaller parameter values.

**Types of regularization:**
- **L1 regularization (Lasso)**: Adds sum of absolute values of parameters
- **L2 regularization (Ridge)**: Adds sum of squared parameters
- **Elastic net**: Combines L1 and L2 regularization
- **Dropout**: Randomly sets some neurons to zero during training (for neural networks)

### Cross-Validation

Cross-validation is a technique for assessing how well a model generalizes to new data by splitting the data into multiple folds and training/testing on different combinations.

**Types:**
- **k-fold cross-validation**: Divides data into k equal-sized folds
- **Leave-one-out cross-validation**: Uses all but one sample for training
- **Stratified cross-validation**: Maintains class distribution in each fold

### Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is the process of selecting, transforming, and creating features that are most relevant for the machine learning task.

**Techniques:**
- **Feature selection**: Choosing the most relevant features
- **Feature scaling**: Normalizing or standardizing features
- **Feature transformation**: Applying mathematical transformations
- **Feature creation**: Creating new features from existing ones
- **Dimensionality reduction**: Reducing the number of features

## Training and Evaluation

### Loss Functions

Loss functions measure how well a model's predictions match the actual values. Different types of problems require different loss functions.

**Common loss functions:**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: For regression problems
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: For regression problems
- **Cross-entropy**: For classification problems
- **Hinge loss**: For support vector machines
- **Log loss**: For probabilistic predictions

### Gradient Descent

Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function by iteratively adjusting parameters in the direction of steepest descent.

**Types:**
- **Batch gradient descent**: Uses entire dataset for each update
- **Stochastic gradient descent (SGD)**: Uses one sample at a time
- **Mini-batch gradient descent**: Uses small batches of data
- **Adaptive methods**: Adam, RMSprop, AdaGrad

### Evaluation Metrics

Different machine learning tasks require different evaluation metrics:

**For Classification:**
- **Accuracy**: Proportion of correct predictions
- **Precision**: True positives / (True positives + False positives)
- **Recall**: True positives / (True positives + False negatives)
- **F1-score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **ROC-AUC**: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve

**For Regression:**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Average squared difference
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Square root of MSE
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Average absolute difference
- **R-squared**: Proportion of variance explained

## Neural Networks and Deep Learning

### Artificial Neural Networks

Artificial neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information through weighted connections.

**Key components:**
- **Input layer**: Receives input data
- **Hidden layers**: Process information through weighted connections
- **Output layer**: Produces final predictions
- **Weights**: Parameters that determine connection strength
- **Activation functions**: Non-linear functions that introduce non-linearity

### Deep Learning

Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple hidden layers to learn complex patterns in data. It has been particularly successful in:
- Computer vision
- Natural language processing
- Speech recognition
- Recommendation systems

**Key architectures:**
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: For image processing
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: For sequential data
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: For long-term dependencies
- **Transformer**: For attention-based processing
- **Autoencoders**: For unsupervised learning

### Backpropagation

Backpropagation is an algorithm that calculates gradients of the loss function with respect to the network's weights by propagating errors backward through the network layers.

**Process:**
1. Forward pass: Calculate predictions
2. Calculate loss
3. Backward pass: Calculate gradients
4. Update weights using gradients

## Transfer Learning

Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model trained on one task is reused as a starting point for a related task. This leverages previously learned features and can significantly reduce training time and data requirements.

**Benefits:**
- Faster training on new tasks
- Better performance with limited data
- Leverages pre-trained features

- **Data transformation**: Scaling, normalization, encoding
- **Feature selection**: Choosing relevant features
- **Data splitting**: Training, validation, and test sets
- **Data augmentation**: Creating additional training examples

## Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning
